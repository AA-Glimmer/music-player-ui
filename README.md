# MusicPlayerUi

An adaptive music player built towards continuous assessment of Adaptive Applications module. This application models the user behaviour and mood explicitly using user's initial preferences and interaction with the application. We find the best suitable song by representing the songs and user in Vector space and calculating the Cosine distance between them over some probability distribution.

This application does not consider security into consideration as the main focus was on user modelling. 

## Development server
